== README

This is a project for a business class. 
The application runs a Rails server that hosts a map of St. Peter Catholic High School.
The user can click on the rooms on each of the three floors to change the colour of the room.

The documentation can be found <a href="http://teamdman.github.io/Floorplan/doc/app/index.html">here</a>. It is auto-generated and a WIP.

The launch script is used for the project currently hosted on <a href="https://preview.c9users.io/teamdman/floorplan">Cloud 9</a>, an online IDE workspace.

The application has only been tested in chrome so far.
